        Physics is Broken?? Mysterious Flying Elevator Spotted
        Zooming Out Of Wonka's Factory
      </h1>
        <br><br><br>
      
      <p>
      On the bright, winter morning, a large, glass cube shot out of Mr Wonka's chocolate factory through the sky. <br><br><br>
      Deafening crashes could be heard from the factory as a giant hole was later seen on the roof of it. The floating object was later identified
        as a transparent elevator, owned by Wonka himself. 
        <br><br>

      "One moment, everything was normal, and another moment, there was this elevator flying and soaring into the sky" says Eva. 
      Willy Wonka has not given any explanation, and instead was later seen smashing through the roof of Charlie Bucket's
        small house.

<p> Although many see the invention of a flying power like this as a momentous occassion, people seemed concerned. 
        "Oh My God! Why does my favourite chocolate factory have an elevator flying out of it? Isn't this a safety hazard ?!"
        said Otto, a 13 year old boy. <br><br><br>

        Wonka is now susceptible to being charged with violation of the sweepstakes law, assult of minors, and the violation
        of the WHS Act. Fans can only hope that Wonka can do something to save himself, but the in the words of Eva, "
        It won't be a piece of cake." </p>
